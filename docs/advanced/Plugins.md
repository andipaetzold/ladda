# Plugins

Ladda was built with extensibility in mind and features a powerful
plugin API to build additional functionality on top of its simple core.

Under the hood Ladda's core functionality (caching, views and
invalidation) is implemented using this API as well.

Check out the [Cheat Sheet](/docs/advanced/Plugins-CheatSheet.md) to get an
overview on a single glance and take a look at our [curated list of
already built plugins](/docs/advanced/Plugins-KnownPlugins.md).
