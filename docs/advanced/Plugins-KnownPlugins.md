- [ladda-logger](https://github.com/ladda-js/ladda-logger)

A more sophisticated version of the plugin we just build. Logs on every
change to the Ladda cache and gives you timings on how long your API
calls take.

- [ladda-observable](https://github.com/ladda-js/ladda-observable)

Adds an observable interface to all `READ` operations. Allows you to be
notified whenever something related to your API call has changed, e.g.
you can observe a list of entities and get notified once one of this
changes is updated.

- [ladda-denormalizer](https://github.com/ladda-js/ladda-denormalizer)

Allows to define denormalization schemas and strategies, so that your
server can send plain ids instead of full entity objects. The plugin
will resolve these ids for you in an optimized fashion, so that your
client-side code can stay simple an operate on full entities.
